        "\n",
        "Quantile-Quantile plots, also known as QQ plots, are a useful tool for comparing data distributions. This notebook will explain what QQ plots are and how to interpret them. The concept of quantiles will be used, which are points in a distribution that relate to the rank order of values in that distribution. For more information on quantiles, refer to the StatQuest video on quantiles and percentiles.\n",

        "\n",
        "A QQ plot is a graphical tool to help us assess if a dataset follows a theoretical distribution. It is constructed by plotting the quantiles of the data against the quantiles of the chosen theoretical distribution. If the data follows the theoretical distribution, the points in the QQ plot will roughly fall on the line $y = x$.\n",

        "Here are the steps to construct a QQ plot:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sort your data**: Arrange the data points from least to greatest.\n",
        "2. **Calculate Quantiles**: Assign each data point a quantile based on its position in the sorted list.\n",
        "3. **Choose a theoretical distribution and calculate its quantiles**: This could be any distribution like Normal, Uniform etc. The chosen distribution should have the same number of quantiles as in the data.\n",
        "4. **Create the plot**: Plot the quantiles from the data (on y-axis) against the quantiles from the theoretical distribution (on x-axis).\n",
        "5. **Interpret the plot**: If the data follows the theoretical distribution, the points will approximately lie on the line $y = x$. If the points deviate from this line, it suggests that the data may not follow the theoretical distribution.\n",
