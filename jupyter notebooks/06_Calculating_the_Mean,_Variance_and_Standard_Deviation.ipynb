    "## Calculating the Mean, Variance and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll discuss how to estimate three fundamental statistics: the mean, variance, and standard deviation. These statistics provide a summary of your dataset's central tendency and variability. To understand these concepts, we'll assume familiarity with histograms, statistical distributions, especially the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal is to estimate population parameters. In statistics, a population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about while a sample is the specific group you collect data from. For instance, if you were trying to understand the average height of all humans, humans would be your population, but you might collect data from a sample of humans in one geographic area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, it's often not feasible to collect data from an entire population. Therefore, we collect data from a sample and use statistical methods to estimate the population parameters. We'll start by discussing how to calculate these parameters if you have data from an entire population and then discuss how to estimate these parameters from a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating a dataset that we'll use to illustrate these concepts.\n",
