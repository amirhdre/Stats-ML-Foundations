    "# Decision and Classification Trees, Clearly Explained!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is mostly used in classification problems. In this technique, we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on the most significant splitter/differentiator in input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm works in a recursive manner by calling itself over and over again. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of a classification problem, the decision node is where we take the input feature and the leaf node is where we output the class label/value. It is called a decision tree because, starting from the root, decisions lead down the branches to the leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will try to explore the concepts and mathematics behind Decision and Classification Trees."
