    "\n",
    "A regression tree is built by partitioning the input space into non-overlapping regions. For any given input point, the prediction is the mean of the output points in that region. The regions are defined by a tree structure, where each internal node splits the input space according to a feature's threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a regression tree, we start with the node that corresponds to the entire input space. Then we search for the feature and threshold that can partition the input space into two regions, such that the sum of the squares of the residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted outputs) is minimized. We do this by trying all possible features and all possible thresholds for
