        "\n",
        "The Maximum Likelihood is a fundamental concept in statistics that shows us the set of parameters that maximizes the likelihood function. The likelihood function measures the goodness of fit of a statistical model to a sample of data for given values of the unknown parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "It plays a key role in statistical inference. The method of maximum likelihood corresponds to many well-known estimation methods in statistics. For example, one may be interested in the heights of adult female penguins, but be unable to measure the height of every single penguin in a population due to cost or time constraints. Assuming that the heights are normally (Gaussian) distributed, the mean and variance can be estimated with MLE while only knowing the heights of some sample of the overall population.\n"
